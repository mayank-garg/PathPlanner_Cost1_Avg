The UAV function here prunes the path based  on :
1. It Finds the avg height of the part of the terrain from which the two nodes pass, whose connectivity we want to check
2. If avg height is lesser than the height of both points, we move to next point, otherwise, add the point just before it and start looking from there.


Blue line Shows the Pruned path, whereas black line shows the path obtained from RRT
